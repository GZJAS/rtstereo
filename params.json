{"name":"Rtstereo","tagline":"Real-Time Stereo Matching","body":"### Introduction\r\nReal-time stereo matching, which is important in many applications like self-driving cars and 3-D scene reconstruction, requires large computation capability and high memory bandwidth. The most time-consuming part of stereo matching algorithms is the aggregation of information (i.e. costs) over local image regions. Here, we present a generic implementation (in OpenCL) for three commonly used cost aggregators on many-core processors. We perform typical optimizations on the kernels, which leads to significant performance improvement (up to two orders of magnitude).\r\n\r\n### Architecture\r\n\r\n![](http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/pds/homepages/fang/docs/icpads2k12_flow.png)\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
