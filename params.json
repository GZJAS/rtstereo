{"name":"Rtstereo","tagline":"Real-Time Stereo Matching","body":"### Introduction\r\nReal-time stereo matching, which is important in many applications like self-driving cars and 3-D scene reconstruction, requires large computation capability and high memory bandwidth. The most time-consuming part of stereo matching algorithms is the aggregation of information (i.e. costs) over local image regions. Here, we present a generic implementation (in OpenCL) for three commonly used cost aggregators on many-core processors. We perform typical optimizations on the kernels, which leads to significant performance improvement (up to two orders of magnitude).\r\n\r\n### Architecture\r\n\r\n![](http://www.pds.ewi.tudelft.nl/fileadmin/pds/homepages/fang/docs/icpads2k12_flow.png)\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\nJ.
